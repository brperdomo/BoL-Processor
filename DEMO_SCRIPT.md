# üé• Technical Demo Script: Nutrient BOL Processor with XTractFlow Integration

## Demo Overview
**Duration**: 8-10 minutes  
**Focus**: XTractFlow .NET SDK integration, technical architecture, and real-world BOL processing workflow  
**Audience**: Technical stakeholders, developers, logistics IT professionals

---

## üé¨ Scene 1: Introduction & Architecture Overview (1-2 minutes)

### Opening Statement
> "Today I'm demonstrating the Nutrient BOL Processor - a production-ready application that leverages Nutrient's XTractFlow SDK for intelligent document processing. This isn't just another demo app - it's a complete integration showing how XTractFlow transforms raw BOL documents into structured, actionable data for logistics systems."

### Architecture Walkthrough
> "Let me show you the technical architecture behind this integration. We have three key components:"

**[Screen: Show ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md - visual overview section]**

> "First, our **React frontend** built with TypeScript and Vite - this handles file uploads, user interactions, and real-time status updates. Users can drag and drop BOL documents in multiple formats: PDFs, JPEGs, PNGs, and TIFFs."

> "Second, our **Node.js Express backend** - this orchestrates the workflow, manages document state, and provides the REST API that connects everything together."

> "And third - the star of the show - our **XTractFlow .NET service**. This is where the real magic happens. It's a production-grade .NET 8 application that integrates directly with Nutrient's GdPicture.XtractFlow SDK."

---

## üé¨ Scene 2: XTractFlow .NET Service Deep Dive (2-3 minutes)

### Show the .NET Service Code
**[Screen: Open `dotnet-service/Program.cs`]**

> "Let's dive into the XTractFlow service. This isn't a wrapper or a mock - this is actual integration with Nutrient's SDK."

**[Point to imports]**
> "Notice these imports: `GdPicture14.XtractFlow` and `XTractFlow.API` - these are the actual Nutrient SDK components. No third-party alternatives, no fallbacks."

**[Scroll to LLM provider setup]**
> "XTractFlow uses Large Language Models for intelligent field extraction. We support both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI providers. The beauty here is flexibility - enterprises can use their existing Azure OpenAI deployments or OpenAI directly."

```csharp
// Point to this code block
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(azureEndpoint) && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(azureKey))
{
    llmProvider = new AzureOpenAIProvider
    {
        AzureOpenAIEndpoint = azureEndpoint,
        AzureOpenAIKey = azureKey,
        AzureOpenAIDeploymentName = azureDeployment ?? "gpt-4"
    };
}
```

> "This enterprise-grade flexibility means organizations can leverage their existing AI infrastructure while getting Nutrient's specialized document processing capabilities."

### BOL Processing Logic
**[Scroll to document processing section]**

> "Here's where XTractFlow processes the actual documents. It's not just OCR - it's intelligent field extraction using AI."

> "XTractFlow takes the uploaded document, applies computer vision for text extraction, then uses the LLM to understand the document structure and extract specific BOL fields like shipper information, consignee details, carrier data, and most importantly - individual cargo items with proper weight separation."

---

## üé¨ Scene 3: Live Application Demo (3-4 minutes)

### Launch the Application
**[Screen: Terminal showing startup]**

> "Let me show you this in action. Starting the application is straightforward:"

```bash
npm run dev
```

> "The Node.js server starts and immediately tries to connect to our XTractFlow service. Notice the status indicator in the top-right - it shows whether we're connected to the real XTractFlow service or running in mock mode for development."

**[Screen: Browser showing the application]**

### Upload and Processing Workflow
> "The interface is clean and purpose-built for logistics workflows. Users can drag and drop multiple document formats. Let me upload this sample BOL document."

**[Drag and drop a BOL file]**

> "As soon as the file is uploaded, several things happen simultaneously:"

**[Point to Processing tab]**
> "1. The document appears in the Processing tab with a progress indicator"
> "2. The Node.js backend creates a document record and sends the file to our XTractFlow service"
> "3. The XTractFlow service receives the binary data and processes it through the Nutrient SDK"

### XTractFlow Processing Deep-Dive
> "Now here's what's happening inside XTractFlow - this is the technical magic:"

**[Screen: Show XTractFlow service logs or API response]**

> "First, XTractFlow performs **document classification** - it determines if this is actually a BOL document or something else. This prevents processing irrelevant documents."

> "Next, it applies **computer vision and OCR** to extract all text from the document, handling various image qualities, rotations, and formats."

> "Then comes the **AI-powered field extraction**. XTractFlow uses the configured LLM with specialized BOL processing instructions to identify and extract specific fields:"

- **BOL Number**: Unique identifier for the shipment
- **Shipper Information**: Company name, address, contact details  
- **Consignee Information**: Destination details
- **Carrier Information**: Transportation company and SCAC codes
- **Shipment Dates**: Pickup and delivery dates
- **Individual Cargo Items**: This is crucial - separate line items with individual weights, quantities, descriptions, and freight classes

### Real-Time Status Updates
**[Switch between tabs showing document progression]**

> "The frontend polls for updates every 2 seconds, giving users real-time visibility into processing status. Documents move through different states based on XTractFlow's confidence scores."

## üé¨ Scene 4: Data Processing Results (2 minutes)

### Show Processed Data
**[Click on a processed document]**

> "Here's the extracted data in structured JSON format. This isn't just text extraction - this is intelligent, business-ready data."

**[Highlight key sections of the JSON]**

> "Notice how XTractFlow has properly separated the cargo items. Instead of concatenated numbers like '478390261317', we get individual items with proper weights: 260 lbs, 184 lbs, 498 lbs. This was a critical fix - logistics systems need individual line items, not merged data."

> "Each item includes:"
- Description of the goods
- Quantity and units
- Individual weight
- Freight class
- Any special handling instructions

### Integration-Ready Output
> "This JSON structure is designed for immediate integration with logistics systems:"

- **WMS systems** can import individual line items for warehouse planning
- **ERP systems** get structured shipment data for invoicing and tracking  
- **TMS systems** receive carrier and routing information for optimization

## üé¨ Scene 5: Development Experience & Deployment (1-2 minutes)

### Developer Experience
**[Screen: Show .NET service setup]**

> "From a development perspective, integrating XTractFlow is remarkably straightforward. The .NET service can run locally for development:"

```bash
cd dotnet-service
dotnet run --urls=http://localhost:8080
```

> "It's also fully containerized with Docker for production deployment:"

```bash
docker build -t xtractflow-service .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key xtractflow-service
```

### Environment Flexibility
> "The system works in multiple environments:"

- **Development Mode**: Mock processing for rapid development and testing
- **Staging**: Real XTractFlow with test credentials
- **Production**: Full XTractFlow integration with production licenses

### Configuration Management
**[Show environment variable setup]**

> "Configuration is environment-variable driven, making it deployment-friendly:"

```bash
XTRACTFLOW_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
XTRACTFLOW_API_KEY=your-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
```
