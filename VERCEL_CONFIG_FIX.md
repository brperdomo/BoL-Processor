# ðŸ”§ **Vercel Configuration State Fix**

## **Problem Identified**
- Configuration state wasn't persisting between serverless function calls
- Each function was creating a new `configurationState` object
- This caused API configuration to reset between requests

## **Solution Applied**
Changed from isolated state to global state:

```javascript
// Before (didn't persist)
let configurationState = { configured: false, ... };

// After (persists across functions)
if (!global.xtractflowConfig) {
  global.xtractflowConfig = { configured: false, ... };
}
const configurationState = global.xtractflowConfig;
```

## **Files Updated**
- `api/xtractflow/status.js` - Uses global state
- `api/xtractflow/config.js` - Uses global state, removed import

## **Expected Behavior After Deployment**
1. Submit API credentials â†’ `configured: true`
2. Status shows "XTractFlow Configured - Demo Mode Active"
3. Configuration persists across all API calls
4. Uploads work with proper authentication status

## **Deploy Command**
```bash
git add api/xtractflow/
git commit -m "Fix Vercel configuration state persistence"
git push origin main
```

This fix ensures your Vercel deployment properly tracks authentication state!
