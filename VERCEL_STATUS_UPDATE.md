# ðŸ”§ **Vercel Issues - Final Resolution**

## âœ… **Issues Fixed**

### 1. Authentication Status Not Updating
**Problem**: App always showed "Mock Mode" even after configuration
**Solution**: 
- Added shared configuration state between API endpoints
- Status endpoint now reflects actual configuration state
- Shows "Configured - Demo Mode" after API setup

### 2. Uploaded Files Not Appearing
**Problem**: Files uploaded successfully but didn't appear in tabs
**Solution**:
- Fixed storage sharing between serverless functions
- Used `global.documentsStore` for cross-function persistence
- Upload and documents endpoints now share the same data

## ðŸš€ **Expected Behavior After Deployment**

1. **Initial State**: "XTractFlow Not Configured - Demo Mode"
2. **After API Setup**: "XTractFlow Configured - Demo Mode Active"  
3. **File Upload**: Files appear in Processing tab, then move to Processed after 3 seconds
4. **Data Persistence**: Uploaded documents persist across page refreshes

## ðŸ“¦ **Files Ready for Deployment**

All serverless functions are updated locally:
- `api/xtractflow/status.js` - Dynamic status tracking
- `api/xtractflow/config.js` - Configuration persistence  
- `api/documents.js` - Shared document storage
- `api/documents/upload.js` - Working file uploads
