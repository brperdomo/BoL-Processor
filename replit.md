# Nutrient BOL Processor

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for processing Bill of Lading (BOL) documents using Nutrient AI-powered document extraction. The system allows users to upload documents, processes them through mock AI services (designed for easy integration with actual Nutrient AI Document SDK), and provides a tabbed interface for managing documents in different states (processing, processed, needs validation, unprocessed). All Replit-specific references have been removed and replaced with proper Nutrient branding.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern dual-service architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Nutrient brand colors and dark theme
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **File Uploads**: React Dropzone for drag-and-drop file upload functionality

### Backend Architecture (Dual-Service Design)

**Node.js Orchestrator Service (Port 5000)**
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Role**: Frontend hosting, workflow coordination, document state management
- **File Handling**: Multer for multipart file upload processing
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API acting as proxy to XTractFlow service

**.NET XTractFlow Processing Service (Port 8080)**
- **Runtime**: .NET 8 with ASP.NET Core Minimal API
- **Language**: C# with Nutrient SDK integration
- **Role**: Pure document processing with actual XTractFlow SDK
- **AI Processing**: Real Nutrient GdPicture.XtractFlow integration
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI and Azure OpenAI provider support

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
1. **FileUploadZone**: Drag-and-drop interface for document uploads
2. **Tab Components**: Separate views for different document states
   - ProcessingTab: Shows documents being processed with progress indicators
   - ProcessedTab: Displays successfully processed documents with extracted data
   - ValidationTab: Manual review interface for documents needing validation
   - UnprocessedTab: Failed documents with retry/delete options
3. **Header**: Navigation with Nutrient branding
4. **UI Components**: Complete set of shadcn/ui components for consistent design

### Backend Components

**Node.js Orchestrator Components**
1. **Document Storage**: In-memory storage implementation with interface for future database integration
2. **File Upload Handler**: Multer-based file processing with type validation
3. **XTractFlow Client**: HTTP client for communicating with .NET service
4. **REST API**: CRUD operations for document management and status tracking

**.NET XTractFlow Service Components**
1. **Nutrient SDK Integration**: Direct GdPicture.XtractFlow API usage
2. **LLM Provider Management**: OpenAI and Azure OpenAI configuration
3. **BOL Processing Engine**: Specialized component for Bill of Lading extraction
4. **Document Classification**: AI-powered document type identification

## Data Flow

1. **File Upload**: Users drag/drop files into the upload zone
2. **Server Processing**: Files are validated, stored, and sent for mock AI processing
3. **Status Updates**: Documents move through different states based on processing results
4. **Real-time Updates**: Frontend polls for updates every 2 seconds to show progress
5. **User Interaction**: Users can retry failed documents, validate questionable results, or download processed data

## External Dependencies

### Database Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Schema**: Defined in `shared/schema.ts` with document table structure
- **Database Provider**: Configured for Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database schema management

### Key Libraries
- **UI Components**: Extensive Radix UI component library
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation and type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS processing
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution, esbuild for production builds

### XTractFlow Integration
- **Production Service**: Complete integration with Nutrient's XTractFlow API for real BOL processing
- **Environment Detection**: Automatically switches between mock and production modes
- **LLM Support**: Compatible with OpenAI and Azure OpenAI providers
- **Natural Language Processing**: Uses AI instructions for field extraction
- **Document Classification**: Intelligent BOL vs non-BOL document detection
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides accuracy metrics for extracted data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to mock processing on API failures
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time API connection status in application header

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Hot Reloading**: Vite development server with HMR
- **API Proxy**: Express server serves both API and static files
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV=development with source maps

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized React bundle to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
- **Serving**: Express serves static files and API from single process

### Database Integration
- Drizzle ORM is configured but uses in-memory storage currently
- Ready for PostgreSQL integration via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Migration system in place for schema updates

The architecture is designed for easy transition from development to production, with clear separation of concerns and modular components that can be independently developed and tested.
