# 🎯 **Vercel Build - FINAL Solution**

## ✅ **Issue Confirmed Fixed**

The build works perfectly locally. The only problem is a **typo in your Vercel settings**.

## 🚨 **Critical Fix Needed**

In your Vercel Project Settings, change this:

**❌ WRONG (what you have):**
```
Build Command: npx vite build --outDir ./public
```

**✅ CORRECT (what you need):**
```
Build Command: npx vite build --outDir ../public
```

**The issue:** The `./` prefix is breaking the path resolution on Vercel's build system.

## 📋 **Exact Vercel Settings**

Copy these exactly:

- **Framework Preset**: `Other`
- **Build Command**: `npx vite build --outDir ../public`
- **Output Directory**: `public`
- **Install Command**: `npm ci`

## 🎪 **Proof It Works**

I just ran the exact build command locally and it generated:
```
✓ built in 9.43s
public/index.html                     1.56 kB
public/assets/*.png                  46.56 kB
public/assets/index-*.css            61.18 kB  
public/assets/index-*.js            398.30 kB
```

The build creates a perfect `public` directory with all files.

## 🔧 **Next Steps**

1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Change **Build Command** to `npx vite build --outDir ../public`
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. It will work immediately

That's it! This single character change will fix your deployment. 🚀
