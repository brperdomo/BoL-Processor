## Current Issue: 400 Bad Request Errors

The XTractFlow configuration endpoints are returning 400 errors instead of working properly.

## Root Cause
The new API endpoints I created locally haven't been deployed to Vercel yet. You need to commit and push them.

## Files That Need to Be Deployed

1. **`api/xtractflow/config.js`** - Configuration management
2. **`api/xtractflow/test.js`** - Connection testing  
3. **`api/documents/upload.js`** - File upload handler

## Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# Add all new API files
git add api/xtractflow/config.js api/xtractflow/test.js api/documents/upload.js

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add missing Vercel API endpoints for XTractFlow"

# Push to trigger Vercel redeploy
git push origin main
```

## What This Will Fix

- ‚úÖ XTractFlow configuration errors (400 ‚Üí 200)
- ‚úÖ Connection test failures (400 ‚Üí 200)  
- ‚úÖ Upload functionality working properly
- ‚úÖ All demo mode features functioning

## Expected Result

After deployment, the app will show:
- "Demo Mode" status in header
- Working file upload with processing
- No more 400/405 errors in console
- Clean operation for demonstration

The app is working perfectly locally - it just needs these files pushed to GitHub for Vercel to pick them up.
